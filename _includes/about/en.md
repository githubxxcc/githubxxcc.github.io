Hi there, this is Ricky. I am a graduate student at [CMU's Master of Computer Science program][1]. Most of courseworks I have done are about system programming, e.g. Operating System, Database System, and etc. I am also a member of the [CMU-DB gang][2], led by [Prof Andy Pavlo][3], and am currently building out infrastructure for self-driving databases.

I love movies (Friday night movie night is a norm) and music (my Spotify is on 24-7).
